<h1> About Me</h1>
		<p> My name is Joshua Klemm and I'm a freshman here at The University of Rhode Island. I'm a computer science major and I graduate in 2026. I went to Mark T. Sheehan high school where I 
graduated with hopes of coming to either URI or Uconn. I eventually decided to come here and pursue something in computer science, while I'm not completely sure what I want to directly 
go into yet I find programming really fun and wish to do something with it.<br>

			<p>I'm completely an outdoors person and love doing anything that relates to it. Whether than be hiking during the summer and spring seasons, or snowboarding in the winter. I would go to 
the mountains every year with my friends and dad all throughout the winter. While there aren't many places near where I lived I could go we ended up going to places like butternut or mount 
snow. I also love anything to do with sports, whether that be watching or playing. I played 4 years of football and high school as well as 4 years of ultimate frisbee. I'm also already in 
the ultimate frisbee club here at URI where I'm having a ton of fun. I've been a die-hard Yankees and Patriots fan since I was young as well.</p>
