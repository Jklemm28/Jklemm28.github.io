<h1> Welcome to my About Me Page</h1>
<div id="para_text">
		<p class="border">My name is Joshua Klemm and I'm a freshman here at The University of Rhode Island. I'm a computer science major and I graduate in 2026. 
		I went to Mark T. Sheehan high school where I graduated with hopes of coming to either URI or Uconn. I eventually decided to come here  
		and pursue something in computer science, while I'm not completely sure what I want to directly go into yet I find programming really fun  
		and wish to do something with it.</p>

		<p class="border">I'm completely an outdoors person and love doing anything that relates to it. Whether than be hiking during the summer and spring seasons,  
		or snowboarding in the winter. I would go to the mountains every year with my friends and dad all throughout the winter. While there aren't 		
		many places near where I lived I could go we ended up going to places like butternut or mount snow. I also love anything to do with sports, 
		whether that be watching or playing. I played 4 years of football and high school as well as 4 years of ultimate frisbee. I'm also already in  
		the ultimate frisbee club here at URI where I'm having a ton of fun. I've been a die-hard Yankees and Patriots fan since I was young as well.</p>
